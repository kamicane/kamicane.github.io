## About me

I am the founder of the [MooTools javascript framework](mootools.net) | [gh](github.com/mootools).

My main area of expertise is JavaScript development, node.js and frontend.
I am an API enthusiast, I love crafting clear, beautiful, easy to use developer APIs.

I have worked with JavaScript for more than 15 years.

## Past Work

My programming carreer started in 2005 when I created a complete CMS software using PHP / JavaScript. This software was then bought by an american company called [Webs](https://www.webs.com/). I then worked with them for a couple of years, going back and forth between Rome and Silver Springs, Maryland.

After that I did remote freelance work for a few years, most notably for Best Buy and [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/).

In 2012 I moved to Stockholm, Sweden to work at [Spotify](Spotify.com).
Working in the client infrastructure team, I have created various tools for development of applications inside the Spotify Desktop client such as [QuickStart](https://github.com/spotify/quickstart) (later open sourced by Spotify) which allowed the full client side stack to migrate to a commonJS architecture. Also worked on enhancing huge (millions of tracks) lists performance in web views.

In 2014 I moved back to Rome, and resumed working as a freelance contractor.

## Notable Open Source Projects

I am an open source enthusiast and I (mostly) create developer libraries. My open source repositories live on [github](github.com/kamicane).

### [Mootools](mootools.net)

MooTools is being actively developed by a [small team of very smart people](http://mootools.net/developers).

Other than being the main and primary developer, I used to manage all code-related contributions, patches, and enhancements. [Source](https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core).

### [QuickStart](https://github.com/spotify/quickstart) (2014)

During my stay at Spotify I developed QuickStart, a commonJS compiler for node.js and browsers.

While similar in scope to Browserify, QuickStart does not require any pre-compilation during development, and can be used to seamlessly make use of commonJS modules in the browsers, making development quick and easy.

### [Moofx](https://github.com/kamicane/moofx) (2005)

MooFx is my javascript animation framework from 2005, precursor to MooTools, revamped in 2012 to support css3 transitions. Though MooFx is mostly an animation framework, it is also used to set and retrieve a normalized version of CSS styles from DOM nodes.

MooFx is fully able to animate transforms, even in browsers without support for css3 transitions, as it implements the W3C specification for [Transitions and animations between transform values](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/#animation) in plain client-side code.

### ART (2007)

ART is a framework for working with, and creating vector images. ART natively supports SVG and VML, providing a standardized API. [Original Source](github.com/kamicane/art)

Art was later improved upon by a fellow MooTools developer at facebook ([source](github.com/sebmarkbage/art)) which is the base for [the official vector renderer for React](https://github.com/reactjs/react-art).

### [PixMap](https://github.com/kamicane/pixmap) (WiP)

PixMap is a pixel manipulation library, for node & browsers. It supports blending, resizing, blurring, cropping, masking, and, of course, direct pixel manipulation.

PixMap works by delegating decoding and encoding of image formats to third parties like sharp or pngjs.

### [Ow Prop Type](https://github.com/kamicane/ow-prop-type)

React prop-types validation with [ow](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ow).

### [Simple FTPd](https://github.com/kamicane/simple-ftpd) (2017)

simple-ftpd is a event based ftp-server for node.js.

### [Harmonizer](https://github.com/kamicane/harmonizer) (2014)

In 2014 I wrote an es6 to es5 transpiler for fun and to familiarize myself with the (at the time) new es6 paradigms.

It is written in es6 syntax, and it transpiles itself to es5.

### [THREE Commonjsify](https://github.com/kamicane/three-commonjsify) (2015)

Following my undying passion for parsing the JavaScript language in JavaScript I created THREE-commonjsify, a node program that transforms the THREE.js source code in commonJS format.

### [Microseconds](https://github.com/kamicane/microseconds) (2018)

Converts microseconds in a human readable string.


It is now obsolete.
