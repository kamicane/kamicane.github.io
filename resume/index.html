            <h4>MooTools (2006-present)</h4>

            <p>I am the lead developer &amp; founder of the MooTools JavaScript framework.
            MooTools is being actively developed by a <a href="http://mootools.net/developers">small team of very smart people</a>.
            I manage all code-related contributions, patches, and enhancements.
            I am also the developer and designer of the <a href="http://mootools.net">MooTools website</a>.
            The source code for MooTools is <a href="https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core">available on github</a>.</p>

            <h4>QuickStart (2014-present)</h4>

            <p>During my stay at Spotify I have developed QuickStart, a commonJS compiler for node.js and browsers. While similar in scope to Browserify, QuickStart does not require any pre-compilation during development, and can be used to seamlessly make use of commonJS modules in the browsers, making development quick and easy. QuickStart is still used at Spotify to develop and publish applications on the Spotify Desktop Client.
            The source code for QuickStart is <a href="https://github.com/spotify/quickstart">available on github</a>.</p>

            <h4>MooFx (2005-2013)</h4>

            <p>MooFx is a javascript animation framework built to support and enhance css3 transitions.
            I created the original version of MooFx in 2005. In 2012 MooFx was revamped to support css3 transitions.
            Though MooFx is mostly an animation framework, it is also used to set and retrieve a normalized version of CSS styles from DOM nodes.
            MooFx is fully able to animate transforms, even in browsers without support for css3 transitions, as it implements the W3C specification for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/#animation">Transitions and animations between transform values</a> in plain client-side code.
            The source code for MooFx is <a href="https://github.com/kamicane/moofx">available on github</a>.</p>

            <h4>ART (2007-2012)</h4>

            <p>ART is a framework for working with, and creating vector images. ART natively supports SVG and VML, providing a standardized API.
            ART prefers to use SVG where available, but falls back to VML in Internet Explorer &lt; 9.
            The source code for ART is <a href="https://github.com/kamicane/art">available on github</a>.</p>

            <h4>WrapUp (2012-present)</h4>

            <p>WrapUp is a CommonJS 1.0 modules compiler and dependency mapper.
            WrapUp is used mainly to create a single JavaScript file out of a list of required modules.
            WrapUp is written in JavaScript, on the node.js platform.
            The source code for WrapUp is <a href="https://github.com/kamicane/wrapup">avaliable on github</a>.</p>

            <h4>Slick (2007-present)</h4>

            <p>Slick is a standalone DOM selector engine for any web browser.
            I wrote Slick in collaboration with MooTools developers to have a fast, solid way to retrieve DOM nodes using CSS syntax.
            The source code for Slick is <a href="https://github.com/kamicane/slick">available on github</a>.</p>

            <h4>Packager (2007-2010)</h4>

            <p>Packager is a dependency resolver program built with PHP5 that I wrote in 2007 to support the <a href="http://mootools.net/core">MooTools online javascript builder</a>.
            Packager is now being phased out and replaced with WrapUp.
            The source code for packager is <a href="https://github.com/kamicane/packager">available on github</a>.</p>
